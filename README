This is sheep.

Sheep provides a framework for accomplishing system tasks such as:

  - compiling and packaging source code builds
  - building images
  - managing git repositories
  - launching virtual instances (kvm)
  - much more 

It is designed with a modular architecture that allows you to hook in 
your own modules which will benefit from the sheep core, such as:

  - sheep resources:
    - option parser
    - remote file
    - remote git repository
    - build helper 
    - package helper 
    - require functionality
    - testing framework

You can start developing interactively by chaging into this directory
and sourcing the sheep binary, like

  source sheep 

or you can run sheep in command line mode by simply invoking it. Call 
it with no arguments to see what the avilable options are.
